Experimentation I'm working on involving music and programming. A lot of PureData projects will be in here, along with some SuperCollider files. 
## Viewing a PureData file / Information on each file
All of the PureData files in this repository are individual projects so far. To view them, download this repository zip and open any files in the PureData program. (Easier ways to view them will be worked on in the future).
